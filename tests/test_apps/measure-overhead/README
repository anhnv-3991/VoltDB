Measure Overhead Application
===========================

Param explanation:

mproscale, mprwscale, sproscale, sprwscale = 
--------------------------------------------

Defines the fractional weight of each procedure in proportion to the sum of weights.
The default setting is 1.0 for sproscale and 0.0 for others, giving 100% spro.
mprwscale=3 and sprwscale=7 would give 30% and 70% respectively.
mproscale=2.5 and sprosca=5.0 would give 33.3% and 66.7% respectively.

Next steps would be to add a max value for each as well.

payloadbytes = 
--------------------------------------------

size of byte[] to send to each procedure.
