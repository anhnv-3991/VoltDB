<!--
Please note that voltify generated the run.sh script assuming a single host,
which is localhost. If you change the host count in this deployment file you
may want to update run.sh.  Look for the server() function and its "voltdb
create" command. Change the "localhost" argument to the appropriate
coordinating host for your network cluster.
